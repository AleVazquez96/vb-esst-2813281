## What is Visual Basic?
The Microsoft® Visual Basic® programming language is a high-level programming language for the Microsoft .NET Framework. Although it is designed to be an approachable and easy-to-learn language, it is also powerful enough to satisfy the needs of experienced programmers. The Visual Basic programming language has a syntax that is similar to English, which promotes the clarity and readability of Visual Basic code.
Wherever possible, meaningful words or phrases are used instead of abbreviations, acronyms, or special characters. 

## This course
This course looks at the fundamental concepts that are part of the `Visual Basic` language. The courses uses Visual Studio 2019 and has course examples available in Console and Windows desktop formats.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `chapter#-video#`. As an example, the branch named `02-03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04-01`) and an end state (`04-01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The `master` branch holds the the initial state of the course and is not used for exercises during the course.
